This project includes the implementation of sevral popular machine learning algorithms, mainly following the notes of coursera course, https://www.coursera.org/course/ntumlone and https://www.coursera.org/course/ntumltwo. In detail, there are the implementation of following algorithms in corresponding folders:

1. PLA: Perceptron Learning Algorithm
2. Kmeans: K-means clustering algorithms
3. CART_DecisionTree: Classification And Regression Tree
4. SVM: Support vector machine (using libsvm, and investigate the kernel function and related quadratic optimization )
5. RandomForest: based on the CART decision tree
6. Adaboost: Adaptive Boosting with decision stump
7. Neural Network: A three-layer artificial neural network with the back propagation algorithm
